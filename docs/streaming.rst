===================
Stream manipulation
===================

.. note::

    Certain constructs are available only for seekable and tellable streams (in-memory and files). Sockets and pipes do not support neither, so you'll have to first read the data from the stream and parse it in-memory, or use experimental ``Rebuffered`` wrapper.


Field wrappers
==============

``Pointer`` allows for non-sequential construction. The pointer first moves the stream into new position, does the construction, and then restores the stream back to original position. This allows for random access within the stream.

>>> d = Pointer(8, Bytes(1))
>>> d.parse(b"abcdefghijkl")
b'i'
>>> d.build(b"Z")
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00Z'

``Peek`` parses a field but restores the stream position afterwards (it peeks into the stream). Building does nothing, it does NOT defer to subcon.

>>> d = Sequence(Peek(Int16ul), Peek(Int16ub))
>>> d.parse(b"\x01\x02")
ListContainer([513, 258])
>>> d.sizeof()
0

``OffsettedEnd`` parses a greedy subcon until EOF plus a negative offset. This way you can read (almost) all data but leave some bytes left for a fixed sized footer.

>>> d = Struct(
...     "header" / Bytes(2),
...     "data" / OffsettedEnd(-2, GreedyBytes),
...     "footer" / Bytes(2),
... )
>>> d.parse(b"\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07")
Container(header=b'\x01\x02', data=b'\x03\x04\x05', footer=b'\x06\x07')


Pure side effects
=================

``Seek`` makes a jump within the stream and leaves it there, for other constructs to follow up from that location. It does not read or write anything to the stream by itself.

>>> d = Sequence(Bytes(10), Seek(5), Byte)
>>> d.build([b"0123456789", None, 255])
b'01234\xff6789'

``Tell`` checks the current stream position and returns it. The returned value gets automatically inserted into the context dictionary. It also does not read or write anything to the stream by itself.

>>> d = Struct("num"/VarInt, "offset"/Tell)
>>> d.parse(b"X")
Container(num=88, offset=1)
>>> d.build(dict(num=88))
b'X'


Other fields
=================

``Pass`` literally does nothing. It is mostly used internally by ``If(IfThenElse)`` and ``Padding(Padded)``.

>>> Pass.parse(b"")
None
>>> Pass.build(None)
b''
>>> Pass.sizeof()
0

``Terminated`` only works during parsing. It checks if the stream reached EOF and raises error if not.

>>> Terminated.parse(b"")
None
>>> Terminated.parse(b"remaining")
TerminatedError: Error in path (parsing)
expected end of stream
