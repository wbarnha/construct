Extending Construct
===================


Adapters
========

Adapters are the standard way to extend and customize the library. Adapters operate at the object level (unlike constructs, which operate at the stream level), and are thus easier to write and are more flexible. For more information see the adapter tutorial.

In order to write custom adapters, implement ``_decode`` and ``_encode``::

    class MyAdapter(Adapter):
        def _decode(self, obj, context, path):
            # called at parsing time to return a modified version of obj
            pass

        def _encode(self, obj, context, path):
            # called at building time to return a modified version of obj
            pass


Constructs
==========

    .. note:: This is a last line of defense. If you are not able to achieve whatever that is you are trying to do with Construct existing classes, you can always write your own parsing classes. In particular, you can copy-paste existing classes into your source code and modify them slighly. This is the best way to go.

Generally speaking, you should not write constructs by yourself:

* It's a craft that requires skills and understanding of the internals of the library (which change over time).
* Adapters should really be all you need and are much simpler to implement.
* To make things faster, try using compilation feature or pypy. The python-level classes are as fast as it gets, assuming generality.

The only reason you might want to write a custom class is to achieve something that's not currently possible. This might be a construct that computes/corrects the checksum of data, altough that already exists. Or a compression, or hashing. These also exist. But surely there is something that was not invented yet. If you need a semantics modification to an existing class, you can post a feature request, or copy the code of existing class into your project and modify it.

There are at least two kinds of constructs: raw construct and subconstructs.

Raw constructs
---------------------

Deriving directly from class ``Construct``, raw constructs can do as they wish by implementing ``_parse``, ``_build`` and ``_sizeof``::

    class MyConstruct(Construct):
        def _parse(self, stream, context, path):
            # read from the stream
            # return object
            pass
        
        def _build(self, obj, stream, context, path):
            # write obj to the stream
            # return same value (obj) or a modified value
            # that will replace the context dictionary entry
            pass
        
        def _sizeof(self, context, path):
            # return computed size (when fixed size or depends on context)
            # or raise SizeofError (when variable size or unknown)
            pass

Variable size fields typically raise ``SizeofError``, for example ``VarInt`` and ``CString``.


Subconstructs
---------------------

Deriving from class ``Subconstruct``, these wrap an inner construct, inheriting its properties (name and flags). In their ``_parse``, ``_build`` and ``_sizeof`` methods, they will call ``self.subcon._parse``, ``self.subcon._build`` and ``self.subcon._sizeof`` respectively.  ::

    class MySubconstruct(Subconstruct):
        def __init__(self, subcon):
            self.name = subcon.name
            self.subcon = subcon
            self.flagbuildnone = subcon.flagbuildnone

        def _parse(self, stream, context, path):
            obj = self.subcon._parse(stream, context, path)
            # do something with obj
            return obj
        
        def _build(self, obj, stream, context, path):
            # do something with obj
            return self.subcon._build(obj, stream, context, path)
            # return same value (obj) or a modified value
            # that will replace the context dictionary entry

        def _sizeof(self, context, path):
            # if not overriden, defers to subcon size
            return self.subcon._sizeof(context, path)
